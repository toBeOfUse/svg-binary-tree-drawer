This project runs on Python and depends on the Tornado and CairoSVG packages. The frontend is written in vanilla HTML and JavaScript.

The Python dependencies are managed by Pipenv; to prepare the environment, install Pipenv and Python 3.9 and run `pipenv install` in the root directory of the project. Then, execute `pipenv run python server.py` to start the server application, or substitute in the other Python files to run their minimal built-in tests.
